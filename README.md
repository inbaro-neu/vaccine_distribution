### Specifications for building the project

This project uses a SQL database (run in MySQL Workbench) and Java code for running the front-end aspect and for easy and straight-forward user interaction.

No IDE specific files have been included in the submission, so you will need to import the project into your preferred IDE to set up. We used IntelliJ and Java 11. Make sure to include the mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar file (used in class) in the project to be able to connect to the database.
